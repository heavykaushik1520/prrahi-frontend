                SECTION 5 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
              </h2>
              <p>
                In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
                collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent
                necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to
                us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as
                payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have
                their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                required to provide to them for your purchase-related
                transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy
                policies so that you can understand the manner in which your
                personal information will be handled by these providers. In
                particular, it shall be remembered that certain providers may be
                located in or have facilities that are located in a different
                jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed
                with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party
                service provider, then your information may become subject to
                the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider
                or its facilities are located.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction
                is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States,
                then your personal information used in completing that
                transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States’
                legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our
                store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or
                application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy
                or our website’s Terms of Service.

                  The token does not contain your personal information directly
